# Diseases-associated genes conservation across species

This analysis explores the cross-species conservation of genes associated with various neurological conditions.
We are using the AUROC as a proxy of the conservation of genes across marmoset, macaque and human.

Curated gene sets for each condition can be accessed here:  
📄 [Google Spreadsheet – Disease Gene Sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11oP8UJAEofMAzROBXA0sFL90YaKX98-JvVZQIWrHim4/edit#gid=1099480292)

For each phenotype, three gene sources were combined:
- Genes from the original GWAS publication
- Curated gene lists used in the **Zeighami et al.** study (Genes extracted from **DisGeNET**)
- A broader version of each gene set also includes genes significantly associated in our own MAGMA analysis.
