## Scope

The Consensus Basal Ganglia Taxonomy is derived from integrated single-nucleus transcriptomic and multiomic profiling across mammalian species and covers major basal ganglia structures, including caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, pallidal segments, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra.

For most users, the HMBA Basal Ganglia Release page should be considered the primary entry point for data exploration and reuse.
